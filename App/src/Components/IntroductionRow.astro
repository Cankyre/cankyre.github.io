        Hey, I'm <strong>Cankyre</strong>. I'm a game developer, chess player
        and arbiter, musician, computer science student, video games enjoyer and
        a <i>huge nerd</i>. I am an admin of the <strong
            >Rotation de Parpaing</strong
        > community.
        <br />
        I am 17, French <i>and</i> German, and currently working in the indie game
        studio called <strong>Agglo</strong> on a game temporarily titled
        <strong>Jerry & the Gloop&trade; Factory</strong>, which I hope you will
        love.
