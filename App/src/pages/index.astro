					Howdy~ I'm <strong>Ale</strong>, lot's of people know me as cake though.
					I'm somewhat of a software developer, though i enjoy doing basically
					anything that is actually fun and mostly relates to computers.
					<br>
					Other stuff to let you know me better, mh, i'm 19, and i live in italy üçï, yeah, that's it, this is supposed to be a short intro!

					If you are my friend you may already know, but I'm very much obsessed
					with open source crap, that's why this website is hosted on my git istance,
					and that's why i use linux, specifically, i'm using <a href="https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/">opensuse tumbleweed</a>
					in this screenshot and i'd say that it is quite the nice distro overall, though i did have some issues with gnome and
					nautilus not working exactly <i>nicely</i> after an update, with that i mean that some python extension for nautilus
					<i>really</i> did not want me to browse my files, but it was quickly fixed by searching for the solution online, in true linux fashion.

						My interests...well, i do enjoy a lot of things, my main ones focus on
						software, i like to learn new technologies, even if it takes me a while. 
						And, as you might have noticed, dear reader, my wallpaper is from an anime, evangelion, and i <i>really like</i> evangelion
						and with like, i mean that it's one of my favorite pieces of media ever, the third impact just resonates with me so much, both
						in the anime ending, and the movie.

					Other than that, i do enjoy coding, making websites, writing css, drawing, making pixel art, trying new technologies...
					i have quite a lot of interests, that i am not going to write here, for now.

					OH yeah! one big hobby of mine is to basically, fuck up my old laptop...yeah...it's my main server
					and yeah, it's underpowered, that's why i rented a couple cheap VPS from Hetzner, and they do the job
					quite nicely, my laptop is now used only for my <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a>, <a href="https://www.navidrome.org/">Navidrome</a>, <a href="https://freshrss.org/">FreshRSS</a>
					, ForgeJo istance and my <a href="https://app.revolt.chat/bot/01FEED7J1V5STJ6QETZAKR8SVA">Revolt bot</a>.<br>
					While my VPS hosts a <a href="https://cinny.ale.pet/">Matrix dendrite istance</a> and a <a href="https://catgirl.pub/">Lemmy istance</a>.<br>
					It has been quite the learning experience for me, haha, i have to thank a <a href="https://me.lea.pet/">friend</a> of mine for teaching me how to use Docker, as i had been too stubborn
					to use it at first.

					Fuck it, if you are reading this and you are a friend of mine, especially irl ones, take this as a way of me coming out, i am trans, i'm a transfem,
